Project: Predictive Analysis of COVID-19 Dataset

Introduction The outbreak of COVID-19 has had a profound impact on global health and society. Understanding the patterns and trends in COVID-19 cases is crucial for public health decision-making. This project aims to perform predictive analysis on the COVID-19 dataset obtained from the Canada statistics website. (Statistics Canada) The dataset comprises 1,048,576 rows and 9 columns, containing information about cases, regions, episode weeks, gender, age groups, hospitalization status, and deaths.

Objectives
  The primary objectives of this project are as follows:
  To analyze the trends and patterns of COVID-19 cases in different regions of Canada over time.
  To perform linear or non-linear regression analysis to predict future COVID-19 cases based on historical data.
  To explore the impact of gender, age groups, hospitalization status, and deaths on COVID-19 cases.
  
Potential Questions to Address Throughout the project, I am going to address the following questions:
Predicting Hospitalization Status: • Can I build a regression model to predict a person's likelihood of being hospitalized based on their age group and gender? • How does the episode week or year correlate with the likelihood of hospitalization?
Predicting Death Status: • Can I build a regression model to predict whether a person is likely to die based on their age, gender, and hospitalization status? • Are there any significant trends or patterns in mortality rates over the times?
Temporal Trends: • Can I use regression to analyze how the episode week or year influences various health outcomes, such as hospitalization or death? • Are there any seasonal patterns in the data?
Regional Analysis: • How do health outcomes (hospitalization, death) vary across different regions (e.g., Atlantic, Quebec, Ontario)? • Is there a correlation between region and the severity of cases or mortality rates?
Interaction Effects: • Are there interaction effects between variables? For example, does age have a different impact on hospitalization for different genders?
Missing Data Analysis: • Can I build regression models to predict missing values (e.g., age group) based on other available information?
Model Validation: • How well do my regression models perform in predicting hospitalization or death? What are the model's accuracy, precision, and recall?
Methodology The project will follow these key steps:
Data Preprocessing: • Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and outliers. • Data Exploration: Visualize and summarize the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): • Analyze trends in COVID-19 cases over time. • Compare COVID-19 cases across different regions. • Explore the distribution of cases by age group, gender, hospitalization status, and deaths.
Predictive Modeling: • Select appropriate regression techniques (linear or non-linear) to predict future COVID-19 cases. • Train and evaluate regression models. • Use time series analysis if necessary to capture temporal dependencies.
Hypothesis Testing: • Test hypotheses related to the impact of gender, age groups, hospitalization status, and deaths on COVID-19 cases.
Tools and Technologies This project will be implemented using Python, leveraging libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.
Expected Outcomes By the end of this project, we expect to achieve the following outcomes: • A comprehensive understanding of the COVID-19 dataset and its characteristics. • Insights into the temporal and regional trends of COVID-19 cases. • Accurate predictions of future COVID-19 cases based on regression analysis. • Statistical evidence regarding the impact of gender, age groups, hospitalization status, and deaths on COVID-19 cases.
